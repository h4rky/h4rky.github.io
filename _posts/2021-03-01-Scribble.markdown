Getting a fresh new notebook was a recurring pleasure in my childhood. Unfortunately, the nicer the notebook was the less likely that I would ever use it. Had I kept them all, I'm sure someone could estimate my age based on how high the pile of pristine stationary would stand.

Years ago, not sure where, I heard of someone who had always had the same problem. Contrary to my case, they had actually come up with a solution. On buying any new notebook, they would immediatelly turn to the first page and scribble all over it. The notebook no longer existing in its untouched purity could now be further sullied with actual use.

So anyway, consider this place scribbled. Whatever it is.
