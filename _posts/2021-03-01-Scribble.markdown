Getting a fresh new notebook was a recurring pleasure during my childhood. Unfortunately, the nicer the notebook the less likely that I would use it. Nothing I could come up with felt good enough to be written or drawn in its pages. Had I kept them all, I'm sure someone could estimate my age based on how high the pile of pristine stationary would stand.

Years ago, not sure where, I heard of someone who had always had the same problem. Contrary to my case, they had actually come up with a solution. After buying a new notebook they would immediatelly turn to the first page and scribble all over it. The notebook would no longer exist in its untouched purity and it could then be further sullied with actual use.

So anyway, consider this place scribbled. Whatever it is.
