<p>I've been to a bunch of doctors. For a long time I've felt like my sleep is not leaving me as rested as it could be, with various theories as to why this could be. Instead of just wondering about it, I did something - I sought the opinion of healthcare professionals!</p>
<p>This is the kind of thing were even ruling out some potential issues is valuable, as that helps you steer towards other things (e.g. better temperature control in my bedroom). I've still got a couple of appointments to go to follow-up on a couple of things they found out, but today was the last of the initial round of appointments</p>
<p>Addressing "small" issues like this is what I think of as "Life by a thousand mends".</p>
