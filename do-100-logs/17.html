<p>I read all volumes of Ayako, a manga by Osamu Tezuka (the "father of manga", he made Astroboy!). Overall I enjoyed it, although I don't think I fully understood everything the author was gettin at. Maybe you need to be better acquainted with Japanese culture and histor of the time. Not a light read in parts, and some very difficult mature themes and plot points.</p>
<p>Depending on edition, all volumes come bound in a single book. The spine has Ayako written on it, in a very thin typeface. It caught my attention sitting on a shelf at the library, which is why I picked it up.</p>
