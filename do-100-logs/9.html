<p>I sent a letter to the editor of a newspaper. With no expectation of publication, I still took care to craft it well. It's the kind of thing one could have easily waved off as "pointless".</p>
    
<p>It got published! It just showed up in the letter section one day. I'm so used to consuming - for the flow to go only one way - that having something I produced be fed back felt surprisingly rewarding! For someone who sometimes struggles with a sense that the "external" world is something that happens to me rather than something I take part in, this was a breath of fresh air. Here was physical proof, distributed around the earth, that I too am a participant.</p>

<p>Plus, it's fun to imagine the places that copies of my letter will reach. Airports? Islands? Recycling bins?</p>
