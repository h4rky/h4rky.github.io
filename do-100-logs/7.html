<p>I went to a small local cinema. It's the kind of thing I used to do, but haven't done since 2019 despite wanting to several times. Not easy for me sometimes.</p>

<p>I chose the film entirely because it had something to do with brutalist architecture. It was alright. Overall enjoyed the experience.</p>

<p>I wasn't sure if I should count this as one of the 100, but it did involve committing and going through with something that I had talked myself out of many times in the past (despite genuinely wanting to go).</p>
