<p>I read one of the memoirs of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew" traget="_blank">Lee Kuan Yew</a>, in which he recollects his upbringing, experience of Japanese occupation, studies in England, early political career, and ultimately his account of how Singapore came to be independent (and separate from Malaysia).</p>

<p>Chonkiest book I've read in years. Lots and lots of detail, with a lot about political maneuvering of which I had little conception of before (in general). Even though I got lost in places (so many names), and can't claim to understand a lot of it, I think I have a greater appreciation for the kind of thing that goes on behind the political scenes.</p>

<p>The second half of the book required some perseverance in parts. The first have was easier to get through, but I do seem to enjoy reading about people's upbringing and formative years in general (I had a similar experience with a biography of Richard Feynman).</p>

<p>Anyway, I have proven to myself that chonky books are back on the menu.</p>
