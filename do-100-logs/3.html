<p>First thing of 2025! I had a pair of trousers with a hole inside of one of the pockets which I had intended to fix by stitching a patch to it. The task kept getting postponed on my to-do list over and over for half a year. Postponed no more!</p>
<p>Completely underestimated the difficulty. I kept doing it wrong! Thought it would take 20 minutes, but took over 2 hours. Originally I was going to mend more things before counting them together as one of the 100. But actually, this little patch took considerable patience, focus, and commitment with an unfamiliar task to finish. Progressive overload. Tiny steps.</p>
