<h2>2025-04-26</h2>

<p>I went out on Kulturnatt Stockholm 2025, an annual evening and night of special cultural events all across the city. To be honest it didn't go as planned. I wasn't feeling great, and the whole thing was feeling a bit overwhelming. My initial plan was to go into the R1 reactor hall at KTH, but the queue was enormous. Eventually I ended up going to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Church,_Stockholm" target="_blank"></a>German Church</a> and listened to two choirs sing. I enjoy choral music, and it's not often I listen to it live. To be honest it was nice to just peacefully sit in a relatively peaceful environment for a while.</p>
<p>The music was ok, a lot of it not quiiite my thing - but there was one song that gave me chills throughout. I think the whole audience was stunned to silence by the end of it. The lady sitting next to me just exhaled "wow". Then applauce broke out. I'm trying to identify the song, but have been so far unsuccessful. I'm trying to contact the choir. Possibly an italian composition from the 1600s? I'll update this entry if I find it.</p>
