<p>I worked out at the gym in the office 3 times. I intend for this to be a regular thing, but 3 sessions felt like a nice number to consider this a "done" thing.</p>
<p>Gym is not the best, but it's still got the essentials and its free. I've been meaning to use it since the end of 2023, feels good to actually do it and not have it hanging in the back of my mind as "something you haven't dared to do".</p>
<p>It's funny how many times I've started "from scratch", but oh well. Here goes another attempt.</p>
