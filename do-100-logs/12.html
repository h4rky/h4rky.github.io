<p>I have completed three sessions with a psychologist regarding social anxiety. There's more to come, but I had set three as a milestone.</p>
<p>There's some stigma regarding therapy, which I think is sad. I've found it helpful! So far I've mentally drawn an analogy between therapy and physiotherapy or even sport's coaching. You spend an hour with an expert, you look at your current situation, then identify one or two areas to work on. You go off and practice/do your exercises, then come back and get more coaching based on how you've done. What you do in the time between sessions is crucial.</p>
<p>"If this is in your record, could it affect certain career paths?" Yes, but not <u>nearly</u> as much as social anxiety already does.</p>
<p>P.S. There's a useful <a href="https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/Resources/Looking-After-Yourself/" traget= "_blank">set of resources</a> from the Centre for Clinical Interventions in Western Australia (not just social anxiety, other things too!).</p>
