<p>I made a spreadsheet to track the average price of stock positions as you buy and sell. The app my girlfriend uses calculates its average in a way we can't rationalise, so I set out to make something to keep track of it in a way that makes sense (to us at least). Hopefully it's right!</p>
<p>I wasn't sure about the best way to do it, so I started by asking ChatGPT. It took me on a wild goosechase, even introducing me to Google Apps Script, which seems usefulâ€”did you know you can create custom menu entries in Google sheets?. I realised it was going nowhere useful, so I did it the old fashioned way: pen and pencil to figure out how to calculate things, and then just built the thing. Works great! Took a couple of hours in total, including the ChatGPT false-start.</p>
