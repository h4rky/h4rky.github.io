<p>I read Meditations for Mortals. It's meant to be read one chapter a day over 28 days (not including introduction and epilogue. Became an enjoyable daily ritual, to read a short chapter while sipping on my coffee.</p>
<p>It's suprising how much of what the author was saying one way or another already fit what I was thinking/doing in the last few months. It's mostly about embracing our finite nature as humans â€” realising that no matter what we do there's always more to do, more to achieve, more to have. You can't have it all, and that's ok.</p>
<p>By abandonding impossible standards we can release ourselves from the pressure and stress that hold us back from <i>actually</i> doing the things that matter.</p>
<p>Anyway, the author waffles on in parts, but overall I think he's got some useful messages in here.</p>
