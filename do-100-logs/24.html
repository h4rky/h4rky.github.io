<p>I read all six volumes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_(manga)" target="_blank">Akira</a>. Previously I had only seen the film, which contains much much less than the manga. I can see why Akira was so influential in media since, although I found the last two volumes dragging out a little bit and the ending was somewhat underwhelming to me. That being said, the art is so intricate and well made that I felt bad for turning the pages so quickly, especially in the more tense action-packed parts.</p>
<p>One of my favourite things from reading this has nothing to do with the manga itself, and everything with how I sourced it. It's the first thing I borrowed from the library system in Stockholm. Going to libraries to pick up the books, return them, and browseâ€”it brings me joy.</p>
