<p>I completed my version of Couch to 5K. Usually my running habit and fitness falls off in early winter and I don't start running again until mid- to late spring. It takes a while to built my fitness up again each time. This time, I started in mid-Febraury! This is the earliest in the year I've been at this level, at least on record. I'm able to do in three 30 minute runs (with a couple of walking breaks) a week.</p>
<p>I've been very mindful to not plan too far ahead, focusing almost entirely on reaching this level in good shape instead. I haven't "failed" a single run, but that's probably because I've been tweaking my plan as I went along depending on how my body was doing. So far it has worked better than fixating on a "vision" of reaching a certain distance by a certain time.</p>
<p>What's next? I'll just keep it at three 30 minute runs per week for a while, to allow the slower physiological adapations to catch-up with my muscles, etc. Only then will I think about more ambitious goals.</p>
