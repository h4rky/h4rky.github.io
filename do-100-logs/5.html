<p>Third version of the page. I had a lot of fun with this one, I even felt "flow" which I haven't experienced in many months. Feeling fulfilled, with a small boost to self-efficacy. I must beware though, chasing flow can also mean avoiding those things which cause discomfort despite having a high pay-off (e.g. learning difficult new things).</p>
    
<p>Main page changes are: added navigation controls, highlighting the currently selected checkbox, and refactored much of the code behind the scenes. There's even a little favicon now.</p>
