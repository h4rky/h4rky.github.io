<p>New colour scheme for hark.page, as well as detecting if a user prefers light or dark mode based on an OS or user agent setting. So yeah, now hark.page won't blind you at night. Don't remember why I stopped trying to do this a couple of months back, but I guess it's finally done.</p>
<p>Colour palette from <a href="https://stephango.com/flexoki" target="_blank">Flexoki</a> by kepano. I've been trying to use it everywhere I can, although I'm not sure if I'm picking things quite right. Maybe I'll tweak it later.</p>
