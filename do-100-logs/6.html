<p>My sewing adventures continue. This time I mended a pair of gray sweatpants that had began to tear between the legs (not as bad as my blue pair!). Once again, this was a task I had postponed for half a year.</p>
<p>I had wanted to finish this in one evening, but once I got tired I started doing silly things like sewing both sides of the sweatpants together. Many other little holes and frayings got fixed up. Satisfying! I can tell I'm getting better a this.</p>
<p>Then today I squatted down at some point and I swear I heard stitching tear. But despite my panicked checking, I couldn't find any damage??</p>
