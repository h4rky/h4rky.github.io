<p>I went for a walk to a place I'd wanted to explore for years. A common theme to some of the things I've done recently are to stop avoiding and do, even if it's going to the cinema or in this case exploring an island in town.</p>

<p>Originally I had set out to go to a museum, but the weather was sufficiently nice that it felt like a waste to be indoors. Instead I headed to <a href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeppsholmen" target="_blank">Skeppsholmen</a>, an island in Stockholm that used to have a heavy naval presence (the name is a clue). The exact destination today did not matter, what mattered was to stop avoiding.</p>

<p>I wandered around, taking in the place for what it both was and is. Kind of inspiring to see people learning new trades, be it blacksmithing, welding, or boat building, at Skeppsholmen's local popular culture and education society.</p>

<p>I don't have some deliverable for today, but I do have a bit more Life.</p>
