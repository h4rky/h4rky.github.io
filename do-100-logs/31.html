<p>I read <em>Just Fucking Ship</em> by Amy Hoy, in one day (as suggested). Do I remember everything? No. But I have a list of techniques now, and the important things is to practice.</p>
<p>The book is short and rough around the edges (although not nearly as rough as the first edition must have been), far from perfect... but I guess that is the point after all. I picked it up as as it was recommended by Cedric Chin. He also has a <a href="https://commoncog.com/just-f-cking-ship/" target="_blank">summary of it over at commoncog</a> which I'm likely to refer to often.</p>
<p>That I'm nearing 1 year into "Do 100 things" and only at thing no. 31 so far is testament that I need this book.</p>
