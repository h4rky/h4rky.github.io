<p>There are two things that I need to get better at: doing, and finishing. With doing I mean actually taking action towards some aim, and with finishing I mean taking action until completion. An example of "doing" could be actually visiting a museum I've been wanting to visit for a while. An example of the latter could be to finish reading a book I'd left halfway. This applies to larger more ambitious things as well - although if you want to get stronger, it's more productive to progressively overload than try to lift your goal weight outright.</p>

<p>Like with many things, repetition helps. Taking inspiration from various people, and in particular <a href="https://x.com/visakanv">@visakanv</a> (see <a href="https://www.visakanv.com/blog/do100things/">this post</a> on his blog), I aim to do 100 things. Now, usually it seems people do this for a specific domain or task e.g. do 100 drawings, or 100 coding projects. But I need to get better at doing in general!

<p>Anyway, first thing done: initial version of this page tracking how many things I've done. Intentionally simple, and quickly done. I think part of getting better at finishing things is to scope things appropriatelly, and knowing when things are "good enough" to declare them done.</p>
