<p>I aim to get better at two things: taking action, and completing things. Like with many things, repetition helps. Taking inspiration from various people, and in particular <a href="https://x.com/visakanv">@visakanv</a> (see <a href="https://www.visakanv.com/blog/do100things/">this post</a> on his blog), I aim to do 100 things. Now, usually it seems people do this for a specific domain or task e.g. do 100 drawings, or 100 coding projects. But I need to get better at doing in general!
    
<p>What counts towards this goal is intentionally vague, and I'm going by vibes only. It could be career related, entirely for fun, or anything really. What matters is that it requires doing until an end state is reached. Now eventually I'd like to be able to reliably tackle large complex tasks, but just like with strength training, progressive overload is the way.</p>

<p>Anyway, the first I've completed is the initial version of this page. It tracks how many things I've done. I've kept it intentionally simple, and did it quickly. I think part of getting better at completing things is to scope things appropriatelly, and knowing when things are "good enough" to declare them done. If more is needed, it can be added later.</p>
