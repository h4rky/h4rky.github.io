<p>I read the entire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showa:_A_History_of_Japan" target="_blank">Showa: A History of Japan</a> series by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Mizuki" target="_blank">Shigeru Mizuki</a>, an interesting guy. It weaves the history of Japan during the Sh≈çwa era together with his personal lived experience of it, from the 1920's all the way to shortly after the death of Emperor Hirohito. He somehow managed to survive being drafted into the Imperial Japanese Army while it was basically a suicide cult, while at the same time being insubordinate and generally careless with the consequences of his decisions. The Imperial Japanese Army really had a doom-loop going, doubling down on any set-back by wiping themselves out. What a bizarre situation, die the way you're supposed to or we'll execute you.</p>
    
<p>I found the post-war years, especially the immediate rebuilding period, to be the most interesting. How does a society move on from such a strange self-inflicted madness?</p>
<p>Anyway, there's a lot more to this series. It's not all war.</p>
