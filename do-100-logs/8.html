<p>I enjoy geolocating photos, so a friend has been giving me pictures she has taken to let me practice. The latest one felt like it should be easy (and in retrospect, could <em>have</em> been), but it took several tries (maybe 4 hours of total effort). Finally, today I sat down with a cup of coffee and fully committed to figuring it out. Turned out to be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand-Place" target="_blank">Grand-Place</a> in Brussels, finally identified by the draped flag of Brussels on a pole and a nearby Starbucks. I may have looked at every Starbucks in Portugal just to convince myself what I already knew from the flag.</p>
<p>Really, it was a good lesson about being aware of what assumptions I'm actually making, and of trusting what I had already figured out.</p>
