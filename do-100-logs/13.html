<p>I attended an open lecture in a public library. I used to do this kind of thing regularly, but haven't in years. The lecutre was about conscription, its relationship to society, and how different states have tried to justify it over time.</p>
<p>It was quite interesting, although much of it wasn't new to me. Some of it were things I already knew or had thought about, but maybe from a slightly different angle. For example, in a society with partial conscription you're to some extent saying "we're choosing you to become a lawful target in case of war, and we're ok with the idea of you dying".</p>
<p>Also, one can have a society which has partly justified conscription by only having a small yearly intake (and thus being able to argue that only those who are essentially volunteers are actually conscripted). However, if the intake is slowly increased you eventually pass a threshold in which you have a large portion of unwilling participants <em>without</em> having had to justify it politically. It just kinda sneaks up.</p>
