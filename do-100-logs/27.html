<p>I read Atomic Habits by James Clear. It was an alright book. I'm getting a fair bit of use from the main concepts it presents so far to make little improvements to my habits, with good results!</p>
<p>My 100 things is featuring a lot of reading books/manga. Not the direction I specifically expected, but at the same time its exactly the kind of effect I want.</p>
<p>I used to read a lot of books. Then for one reason or another I started having difficulty actually finishing them, to the point that in my mind I became "the sort of person who doesn't finish books". This made reading even more unappealing, so I stopped reading. In my mind I became "the sort of person who doesn't read books". Atomic Habits is a book I'd meant to read a long time ago (in fact I tried, once), but it actually was firmly in my mind as "the kind of book I can't finish and won't read" so no attempt was ever made. Over the past few months I've ended up reading more, and making a point of finishing. Each time a small casting a vote towards being "the kind of person who reads books".</p>
<p>This is actually something Atomic Habits talks about. Who you beleive you are has an effect in what you do, and what you do has an effect on who you beleive you are.</p>
<p>I started 100 things to finish more things and do more "intentional" things. I've regained confidence in reading books, and as a consequence I read a book about habits, and as a consequence I've been fixing habits that help with the goal! Funny how things work.</p>
