<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moomins_and_the_Great_Flood" target="_blank">I read a book</a>. Granted, a very short book. But it was fun and whimsical, and in Swedish. You can tell the idea of the Moomin universe is still taking shape. These proto-moomins sparked joy.</p>

<p>Trivial? It wasn't too challenging. But it still required redirecting myself from usual habits - comitting to and completing this feels more like <b>doing</b> than an n-th hour trying to reach the end of an infinite scroll. Exactly the kind of effect I want out of "Do 100 things". Plus, I needed to take a break from <em>The Singapore Story.</em></p>
